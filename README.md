# Movie Rental SQL Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project involves exploring a movie rental database using SQL. You'll write queries to analyze the data and answer interesting questions through both code and visualizations. The goal is to present insights using a combination of SQL, data interpretation, and visual storytelling.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Understand and explore the structure of the movie rental database.
- Write SQL queries to investigate various aspects of the data.
- Create visualizations to support your findings.
- Present your results in a clear and structured format.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `slides/` – Contains the final presentation slides with:
  - A question of interest
  - The SQL query used
  - A supporting visualization
  - A brief summary of findings

- `queries.sql` – A text file containing the SQL queries used to answer the four main questions.

- `visualizations/` – Optional folder to store charts, graphs, or plots used in your slides.

## 📌 Project Submission Includes
- ✅ A slide presentation with four data-driven insights.
- ✅ Each slide includes:
  - A key question
  - An SQL query that answers it
  - A visualization of the results
  - A short summary of findings
- ✅ A `.sql` file with all the queries used.

## 📚 Getting Started
To explore or reproduce this project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Connect to the movie rental database (e.g., using PostgreSQL or SQLite).
3. Run the queries in `queries.sql`.
4. Create visualizations using your tool of choice (Excel, Tableau, Matplotlib, etc.).
5. Compile your insights into a presentation.

## 💡 Notes
- Practice quizzes were used during the learning phase to ensure understanding.
- This project is designed to help build real-world SQL and data presentation skills.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL / SQLite)
- Data Visualization tools (Matplotlib / Excel / Tableau)
- Presentation (Google Slides / PowerPoint)
